        <p>At seemingly miscellanous intervals I write poems to process various feelings, experiences or ideas and eventually found that they often exist best as spoken word pieces. There are now many pieces that I plan to record and share simply because it seems they need to be ‘out there’. But I take forever to get round to things, especially when they’re optional (and intimidating). And I also have very little experience performing spoken word as of yet.</p>

        <p>For a bit I’d been leaving the link to 'First Draft' up in my ig bio to get over my shyness and perfectionism relative to other people hearing what I wrote, particularly because it was a very low-fi spur-of-the-moment recording. Initially I hoped that the self-consciousness from already having a revised version prepped pretty soon after would incentivise me to put together an improved 'Version Two' rather quickly, but apparently not. Though I do feel less fussed about being heard. For now I’m including it here instead in the interim - with slightly more context - as I anticipate transitioning towards sharing more work.</p>

        <h2 id="placetosay">A Place To Say</h2>

        <p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CwyLgXLIf04/">this instagram post</a>, an invite to contribute to the TARIFF Zine led to a spontaneous poem that currently serves as a sort of inadvertent artist's statement (something I've never usually been too keen on). The full text is below along with the images I produced for it.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <h3>A Place To Say</h3><br />
            <br />
            <span class="whitetxt">(SOMETHING INCREDIBLE<br />
            …or Not Much At All?)</span><br />
            <br /><br />
            And here I had<br />
            just a little more time to think<br />
            “but still try thinking quickly!”<br />
            (I thought)<br />
            everything I do takes long and<br />
            I never have that much time once I finally<br />
            get round to things<br />
            <br />
            But what am I even doing here?<br />
            I am so unsure of it<br />
            unsure of myself<br />
            <br />
            There are things I'd like to articulate <br />
            at some point<br />
            but I can’t tell if now is the right time<br />
            and I'm scared that the wrong timing <br />
            will have the wrong effect<br />
            though it might just be that <br />
            I don’t actually know what those <i>things</i> are yet <br />
            <br />
            At times I'll like to picture it<br />
            as if most of me has been <br />
            buried somehow <br />
            and I can rise from that <br />
            dig back through cold damp mud<br />
            find myself small, green, soft and lightly plump<br />
            a sprout stretching open slightly, excited<br />
            tentative <br />
            purposeful<br />
            see that in the right circumstances <br />
            rot brings fertility <br />
            <br />
            Yet it can also bring the stench of futility<br />
            <br />
            Like seriously, what’s the point <br />
            of all this waffling?<br />
            is it just pretentiousness?<br />
            and likely meaningless to most people<br />
            and maybe only mildly resonant <br />
            for a brief moment <br />
            to those who already have their minds primed <br />
            to make use of something like this<br />
            primed by factors that <br />
            have nothing to do with me<br />
            like, if it’s effective it’s nothing of my doing<br />
            <br />
            But I'd still like to do something <br />
            and it seems many other people would too <br />
            <br />
            So again and again<br />
            I cycle back to wondering <br />
            whether there’s ever a way to do <br />
            something <br />
            that’s worthwhile in most people’s eyes<br />
            or if it’s just about choosing a camp (or a choir) <br />
            to do your best with<br />
            <br />
            Clearly, I might not find that out for quite a while <br />
            <br />
            Regardless<br />
            it’s hard not knowing<br />
            what’s right or <br />
            where you fit <br />
            or <br />
            how to ensure value in what you’re doing<br />
            <br />
            So here I am <br />
            seemingly ready to<br />
            slink back <br />
            into settling for that Schrödinger’s solution<br />
            <i>everything is unfit and excusable all at once</i><br />
            because ‘subjectivity’<br />
            so to speak<br />
            <br />
            No answers, just answering to or for <br />
            what of it?<br />
            <br />
            Well <br />
            I watched a video once <br />
            that included this suggestion<br />
            that the bright colours in the 80s <br />
            were influenced <br />
            by a progression in film photography <br />
            and synthetic materials <br />
            for example<br />
            <br />
            And then later that the excess <br />
            of frills and sequins in all that early 00’s fashion <br />
            was a result of the increase in<br />
            cheap mass manufacturing methods<br />
            <br />
            Makes sense<br />
            and it got me thinking<br />
            what is it<br />
            about the way our technology is now <br />
            that determines our current inclinations?<br />
            like, in art as well as fashion <br />
            <br />
            The most obvious development to blame <br />
            for what brought about such notable change <br />
            would be the internet<br />
            I have a lot to say about the internet<br />
            but I'll save that for another time<br />
            <br />
            Going by my evaluation so far though<br />
            is this the ‘Revisionist Era’? <br />
            that’s what I'm keen to call it <br />
            with all this endless access to <br />
            <i>recordings</i> or <i>representations</i><br />
            of our collective past <br />
            <br />
            Why not look back?<br />
            and revisit <br />
            and revise<br />
            and rehash and regurgitate until any quality <br />
            that was actually good <br />
            within previous creative outputs<br />
            is unquestionably drained for good <br />
            <br />
            Comes down to who gets to ruin it <br />
            for everyone else <br />
            I suppose<br />
            <br />
            Which means it follows that, allegedly<br />
            “everything has been done before” <br />
            and now it gets reborn once more<br />
            or several times <br />
            usually in a kind of <br />
            collage of references <br />
            <br />
            Simultaneously we seem to be revelling in<br />
            showcasing sentimental splendour <br />
            and suffering a sort of sampling sickness <br />
            occasionally it works out all right<br />
            often it kind of doesn’t<br />
            <br />
            Anyway, another time <br />
            a while before watching the video <br />
            I attended a lecture <br />
            that suddenly depicted many typical ideals<br />
            for creative ways of thinking <br />
            that I took for granted <br />
            (for what creative thinking <i>is</i>)<br />
            as a product of relatively recent movements<br />
            subvert this, innovate that <br />
            demonstrate intellect by <br />
            communicating with the conceptual<br />
            and incorporating the abstract<br />
            etc etc<br />
            <br />
            So after a while of doing the internal whining about how <br />
            nothing is ever subverting much of significance <br />
            and  <br />
            no one is ever truly innovating (myself included) <br />
            I caught myself in a bind <br />
            <br />
            Because <br />
            if those are simply the values <br />
            of one particular time<br />
            not fundamental truths of existence <br />
            then why do they matter that much anyway<br /> 
            and isn’t it, contrarily <br />
            convention to attempt to follow them?<br />
            but then <br />
            wouldn’t an attempt to dismiss those values <br />
            be an attempt to subvert them? <br />
            <br />
            So I almost give up<br />
            trying to work that part out<br />
            <br />
            But feeling before thinking seems to help<br />
            <br />
            I keep to asking myself what’s resonated so far<br />
            not due to any enduring <br />
            philosophical rationalisations<br />
            or intellectual posturing<br />
            (at least not consciously)<br />
            but simply because encountering it was <br />
            rewarding to me<br />
            automatically <br />
            or even intuitively?<br />
            inevitably for a reason <br />
            yet I prefer to explore that afterwards<br />
            <br />
            I guess with all this I'm hoping<br /> 
            to find my place<br /> 
            in some fabled centre point <br />
            between every significant influence I've retained<br />
            and work out how to implement a depiction of that<br /> 
            as a sort of assimilated whole<br />
            developing and demonstrating my own agency<br />
            experiencing myself as someone <br />
            who can create with similar effects<br />
            to what inspires awe in me<br />
            <br />
            But surely creativity is a social act<br />
            a celebration <br />
            of the complexity in our communication <br />
            within us <br />
            between ourselves <br />
            and with the world <br />
            <br />
            Doesn’t it then do well to exist<br />
            in exchange with others?<br />
            after all, what we experience socially is usually<br />
            the most important aspect of our lives<br />
            <br />
            So there’s that too<br />
            to seek out the path to existing in relation to <br />
            some form of community <br />
            <br />
            Therefore <br />
            the Introverted Investigation proceeds: <br />
            <br />
            Could this creative output of mine be a method<br />
            for identifying and depicting <br />
            even if sometimes very superficially <br />
            my place in the world? <br />
            <br />
            A dull form of divination perhaps<br />
            testing the tools of tradition<br />
            to weld this messy mass <br />
            of material forged from my subconscious <br />
            a recycling of jumbled encounters<br />
            with what’s already come before myself<br />
            bringing forth the previously unknown<br />
            <i>transformed and tangible</i><br />
            <br />
            And here I sow the seeds of something<br />
            something that in predecessive forms<br />
            worked for several others<br />
            <br />
            A glimmer of a galactic gamble <br />
            (socially, as I mentioned)<br />
            braving the risk of ridicule, rejection<br />
            or disinterest<br />
            <br />
            A hope to uncover and depict<br />
            these concurrent fragments of <br />
            this universe hidden deep inside myself <br />
            as I'd like to imagine it<br />
            <br />
            Then maybe one day <br />
            I too can capture grand complexity<br />
            through the strength of balanced simplicity <br />
            with a nod to my knowledge of nuance<br />
            and trial all manner of hesitant experiments<br />
            led mostly by my longing <br />
            to get more out of this life<br />
            and belong<br />
            <br />
            At the moment I call this project<br />
            ‘Some Other World’ <br />

        <img src="SOWselection.jpg">
        <p>As I've worked to re-establish a creative practice over the past few years following a rocky experience of studying art, the core of it has centred on an ongoing collection of drawings I refer to under the project title 'Some Other World'. The act of navigating this creative process itself has remained so prominent that my aims for the project now include incorporating aspects of that contextually. This is the main thing I intend to build towards presenting but is still very much in progress, so for now here's a photo overview of some of my related sketchbooks and such.</p>

        <p>I'm at the very early stages of learning web design & development. Two examples (besides this page, which is just <strike>a Markdown file with custom CSS</strike> a static site hosted on GitHub pages) that are up right now are:</p>

        <h3 class="link"><a href="https://grahamcunnington.com">Graham Cunnington</a></h3>

        <p>A first attempt at using Grav CMS to build a custom site. Gray also provides production studio services, which you can see more about on the site - so check that out if it's of use to you. There'll be more content and features to come in the future too.</p>

        <p>This was a simple redesign of an existing draft for the Bristol-based collective Out the Window (connected to the TARIFF zine).</p>
